📘 What did you learn?  
I learned how to:

- Build a multi-page layout using HTML and CSS
- Style responsive components with modern CSS
- Handle dynamic data (adding and deleting orders) using JavaScript
- Structure a project with separate folders for HTML, CSS, JS, and images

⏱️ How long did it take?  
It took me around 2–3 days to complete.  
I spent extra time refining the design and layout to make it look clean and professional.
